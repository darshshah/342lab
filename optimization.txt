1. Eliminated use of 2 registers (r4 and r5) which were used to store the function arguments. Instead, we directly used the registers in which the function arguments were passed. 

2. Instead of counting up and comparing with the dst string length, we used a countdown loop which will count from dst lenght to 0. Hence, we eliminated one compare instruction. 

3. We modified the code to store the keyvalue in src string everytime without a check. Hence we reduced a load and a compare insruction. 

4. We loaded the value from the destination string into the instruction pointer (r12) directly instead of moving it to a local register and copying it to r12. 

5. We removed an additional loop which was used to subtract the ascii value of dst srting with 23 and compare with 22. Now we just used single loop to achieve this.
